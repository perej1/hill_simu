%% WHAT is PDF/A
%%
%% PDF/A is the ISO-standardized version of the pdf. The standard's goal is to
%% ensure that he file is reproducable even after a long time. PDF/A differs
%% from pdf in that it allows only those pdf features that support long-term
%% archiving of a file. For example, PDF/A requires that all used fonts are
%% embedded in the file, whereas a normal pdf can contain only a link to the
%% fonts in the system of the reader of the file. PDF/A also requires, among
%% other things, data on colour definition and the encryption used.
%% Currently three PDF/A standards exist:
%% PDF/A-1: based on PDF 1.4, standard ISO19005-1, published in 2005.
%%          Includes all the requirements essential for long-term archiving.
%% PDF/A-2: based on PDF 1.7, standard ISO19005-2, published in 2011.
%%          In addition to the above, it supports embedding of OpenType fonts,
%%          transparency in the colour definition and digital signatures.
%% PDF/A-3: based on PDF 1.7, standard ISO19005-3, published in 2012.
%%          Differs from the above only in that it allows embedding of files in
%%          any format (e.g., xml, csv, cad, spreadsheet or wordprocessing
%%          formats) into the pdf file.
%% PDF/A-1 files are not necessarily PDF/A-2 -compatible and PDF/A-2 are not
%% necessarily PDF/A-1 -compatible.
%% All of the above PDF/A standards have two levels:
%% b: (basic) requires that the visual appearance of the document is reliably
%%    reproduceable.
%% a (accessible) in addition to the b-level requirements, specifies how
%%   accessible the pdf file is to assistive software, say, for the physically
%%   impaired.
%% For more details on PDF/A, see, e.g., https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF/A
%%
%%
%% WHICH PDF/A standard should my thesis conform to?
%%
%% Primarily to the PDF/A-1b standard. All the figures and graphs typically
%% use in thesis work do not require transparency features, a basic '2-D'
%% visualisation suffices. The font to be used are specified in this template
%% and they should not be changed. However, if you have figures where
%% transparency characteristics matter, use the PDF/A-2b standard. Do not use
%% the PDF/A-3b standard for your thesis.
%%
%%
%% WHAT graphics format can I use to produce my PDF/A compliant file?
%%
%% When using pdflatex to compile your work, use jpg, png or pdf files. You may
%% have PDF/A compliance problems with figures in pdf format. Do not use PDF/A
%% compliant graphics files.
%% If you decide to use latex to compile your work, the only acceptable file
%% format for your figure is eps. DO NOT use the ps format for your figures.

%% USE one of these:
%% * the first when using pdflatex, which directly typesets your document in the
%%   chosen pdf/a format and you want to publish your thesis online,

%% * the second when you want to print your thesis to bind it, or
%% * the third when producing a ps file and a pdf/a from it.

written into the pdf file's metadata. Write here the text that goes into the 
metadata. The metadata cannot contain special characters, linebreak or paragraph 
break characters, so these must not be used here. If your abstract does not contain 
special characters and it does not require paragraphs, you may take advantage of 
the abstracttext macro (see the comment below). Otherwise, the metadata abstract 
text must be identical to the text on the abstract page.

%% work. Write here the copyright text you want. It is written into the metadata
%% of the pdf file as well.
%% Syntax:
%% \copyrigthtext{metadata text}{text visible on the page}
%% 
%% In the macro below, the text written in the metadata must have a \noexpand
%% macro before the \copyright special character, and macros (\copyright and
%% \year here) must be separated by the \ character (space chacter) from the
%% text that follows. The macros in the argument of the \copyrighttext macro
%% automatically insert the year and the author's name. (Note! \ThesisAuthor is
%% an internal macro of the aaltothesis.cls class file).
%% Of course, the same text could have simply been written as
%% \copyrighttext{Copyright \noexpand\copyright\ 2018 Eddie Engineer}
%% {Copyright \copyright{} 2018 Eddie Engineer}
%%
\copyrighttext{Copyright \noexpand\copyright\ \number\year\ \ThesisAuthor}
{Copyright \copyright{} \number\year{} \ThesisAuthor}

%% You can prevent LaTeX from writing into the xmpdata file (it contains all the 
%% metadata to be written into the pdf file) by setting the writexmpdata switch

\section{Backround}

\subsection{Fisher-Tippett-Gnedenko Theorem}

First approach to study the behavior of extreme events could be to find limiting distribution of the sample maxima $M_n = \max(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n)$. Here $X_1, X_2, ..., X_n$ are i.d.d. random variables from cdf $F_X$. Function for the cdf of $M_n$ can be easily derived, since $X_1, X_2,..., X_3$ are i.d.d.
\begin{gather*}
P(\max(X_1, X_2, ... , X_n) \leq x) = P(X_1 \leq x, X_2 \leq x,..., X_n \leq x) = \\
P(X_1 \leq x) P(X_2 \leq x) ... P(X_n \leq x) =  F^n(x).
\end{gather*}

Now it can be shown that this approach is not very useful since

\begin{gather*}
\lim_{n\to\infty} F^n(x) = 
\begin{cases}
0, x < x^* \\
1, x \geq x^*.
\end{cases}
\end{gather*}

To achieve a nondegerate distribution it is necessary to normalize the sample maxima $M_n$. After normalization a nondegenate distribution is gained as stated in the Fisher-Tippett-Gnedenko Theorem \cite{deHaan}.

\begin{theorem}
There exists real constants $a_n>0$ and $b_n \in \mathbb{R}$ such that 

\begin{equation*}
\lim_{n\to\infty} F^n(a_nx + b_n) = G_{\gamma}(ax+b),
\end{equation*}
where
\begin{equation*}
G_{\gamma}(x)=
\begin{cases}
\exp(-(1 + \gamma x)^{-\frac{1}{\gamma}}), \gamma \neq 0 \\
\exp(-e^{-x}), \gamma = 0,
\end{cases}
\label{mdaEq}
\end{equation*}
for all x with $1+\gamma x > 0$ where $\gamma \in \mathbb{R}$.

\end{theorem}

\section{Hill Estimator}

\subsection{Consistency}

The following theorem states that Hill estimator is consistent i.e. estimator converges in probability to extreme value index. \cite{deHaan}


\begin{theorem}
Let $X_1, X_2,...$ be i.d.d. variables with cdf $F_X$. Suppose $F_X \in D(G_{\gamma})$ with $\gamma > 0$. Then as $n \rightarrow \infty$, $k=k(n)  \rightarrow \infty$, $\frac{k}{n} \rightarrow \infty$,

\begin{equation*}
\hat{\gamma}_H \xrightarrow{p} \gamma.
\end{equation*}
\label{hillcons}
\end{theorem}

For the proof of the above theorem following lemmas are needed, firstly the Renyi's representation \cite{renyi}.
\begin{lemma}
If $E_1, E_2,...$ are i.d.d. random variables from the standard exponential distribution and $E_{1,n} \leq E_{2,n} \leq ... \leq E_{n,n}$ then for $k \leq n$ we have
\begin{multline*}
%\begin{equation*}
%\begin{split}
\big(E_{1,n}, E_{2,n}, ... , E_{k,n}\big) 
\overset{d}{=} \Big(\frac{E_1^*}{n}, \frac{E_1^*}{n}+\frac{E_2^*}{n-1}, ... , \frac{E_1^*}{n}+\frac{E_2^*}{n-1}+...+ \frac{E_k^*}{n-k+1}\Big),
%\end{split}
%\end{equation*}
\end{multline*}
where $E_1^*,E_2^*,...$ are i.d.d. random variables from standard exponential distribution.
\label{renrep}
\end{lemma}

Secondly the lemma about the order statistics of Pareto distribution is necessary \cite{deHaan}.

\begin{lemma}
Let $Y_1, Y_2, ...$ be i.d.d. random variables from Pareto distribution $F_Y(y)=1-\frac{1}{y}$, $y \geq 0$ and let $Y_{1,n} \geq Y_{2,n} \geq ... \geq Y_{n,n}$ be the nth order statistics. Then with such $k=k(n)$ that $k \rightarrow \infty$, $\frac{k}{n} \rightarrow 0$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$,

\begin{equation*}
\lim_{n\to\infty} Y_{n-k,n} = \infty  \quad  \text{a.s}.
\end{equation*}
\label{asconv}
\end{lemma}

Last lemma that we need says that U(Y) is equal in distribution to X, where Y is random variable from pareto distribution and X is random variable from some distribution $F_X$.

\begin{lemma}
Let $Y$ be random variable from Pareto distribution $F_Y=1-\frac{1}{y}$, $y \geq 0$ Let X be random variable with cdf $F_X$ then $U(Y) \overset{d}{=} X$.
\label{U}
\end{lemma}

Next we prove the lemma \ref{asconv}. Proof of the lemma \ref{renrep} is omitted here.

\begin{proof}
Let us assume that $Y_{n-k,n} < r$ for some $r > 0$ infinitely often. In other words
\begin{equation*}
\frac{k}{n} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \mathbbm{1}(Y_i>Y_{n-k,n}) > \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \mathbbm{1}(Y_i>r).
\end{equation*}

Now the left side of the equation converges to zero, since
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \mathbbm{1}(Y_i>Y_{n-k,n}) = \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{k}{n} =0.
\end{equation*}

But the right side converges to $1/r$ almost surely, since

\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \mathbbm{1}(Y_i>r) \xrightarrow{a.s} P(Y_i>r) = 1-F_Y(r) = \frac{1}{r}
\end{equation*}
by the strong law of large numbers \cite{rosenthal}.
So the assumption cannot hold which implies that

\begin{equation*}
P(\lim_{n\to\infty} Y_{n-k,n} = \infty)=1.
\end{equation*}
\end{proof}

Now we prove the last lemma \ref{U} that is needed for the proof of theorem \ref{hillcons}

\begin{proof}
Let's study the condition $U(Y) \leq a, a \in \mathbb{R} $.
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
U(Y) \leq a \\
\Leftrightarrow \inf\big\{x: \frac{1}{1-F_X(x)} \geq Y\big\} \leq a
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation}
\Leftrightarrow \inf\big\{x: 1 - \frac{1}{Y} \leq F_X(x)\big\} \leq a
\label{infeq}
\end{equation}


Let $S=\big\{x: 1 - \frac{1}{Y} \leq F_X(x)\big\}$ and $b = \inf S$. Notice that F is increasing and right-continuous, since F is a cdf. So S is an interval of form $[b,\infty)$ or $(b, \infty)$, since F is increasing. Let's define a sequence $x_n=b+\frac{1}{n}, n\in \mathbb{N}$. Notice that $x_n \rightarrow b$ and $x_n \in S$ for all $n$. Now right-continuity implies that $b \in S$ i.e $S$ is an interval $[b, \infty)$. Additionally $a \in S$ since $a\geq b$ so $a$ satisfies the condition $1-\frac{1}{Y} \leq F(a)$. Therefore the equation \ref{infeq} implies
\begin{equation*}
U(Y) \leq a \Leftrightarrow 1 - \frac{1}{Y} \leq F_X(a) \Leftrightarrow Y \leq \frac{1}{1-F(a)},
\end{equation*}
So now from the cdf of U(Y) we have
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
F_{U(Y)} = P(U(Y) \leq x) = P\Big(Y \leq \frac{1}{1-F_X(x)}\Big) = F_Y\Big(\frac{1}{1-F_X(x)}\Big) \\
= 1-\Big(\frac{1}{1-F_X(x)}\Big)^{-1} =F_X(x).
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
\end{proof}



Now we are equipped to prove the theorem \ref{hillcons}.

\begin{proof}

$F \in D(G_{\gamma>0})$ is equivalent to the fact that $U \in RV_{\gamma}$ i.e.

\begin{equation*}
\lim_{t\to\infty} \frac{U(tx)}{U(t)} = x^{\gamma}.
\end{equation*}

From the uniform convergence of the regularly varying functions follows that for $x>1$ and $t \geq t_0$,

\begin{equation*}
(1-\varepsilon) x^{\gamma - \delta} < \frac{U(tx)}{U(t)} < (1+\varepsilon) x^{\gamma + \delta},
\end{equation*}

for all $\varepsilon>0$ and $\delta>0$. By taking natural logarithm from both sides of the equation above, it can be written as

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\log(1 - \varepsilon) + (\gamma - \delta) \log(x) < \log(U(tx)) - \log(U(t)) \\
< \log(1 + \varepsilon) + (\gamma + \delta) \log(x).
\end{split}
\label{logRV}
\end{equation}

If $Y_1, Y_2,...$ are i.d.d random variables from Pareto distribution with cdf $F_Y(y) = 1 - \frac{1}{y}$ then $U(Y_i)  \overset{d}{=} X_i$  as stated in theorem \ref{U}. Hence it is sufficient to prove the result for $ \hat{\gamma}_H =  \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \log(U(Y_{n-i,n})) - \log(U(Y_{n-k,n})) $. For $t = Y_{n-k,n}$ and $x =\frac{Y_{n-i,n}}{Y_{n-k,n}}$ equation \ref{logRV} has the form


\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\log(1 - \varepsilon) + (\gamma - \delta) \log\Big(\frac{Y_{n-i,n}}{Y_{n-k,n}}\Big) < \log(U(Y_{n-i,n})) - \log(U(Y_{n-k,n})) \\
< \log(1 + \varepsilon) + (\gamma + \delta) \log(\frac{Y_{n-i,n}}{Y_{n-k,n}}).
\end{split}
\label{log}
\end{equation}

Notice that we can replace t with $Y_{n-k,n}$ because we can always find some $n_0$ such that $Y_{n_0-k,n_0} \geq t_0$ according to lemma \ref{asconv}. Furthermore, $Y_{n-i,n}$ is greater than $Y_{n-k,n}$ always when $i<k$. Therefore x can be replaced with $\frac{Y_{n-i,n}}{Y_{n-k,n}}$.

Equation \ref{log} applies for every $i = 0,1,2,..., k-1$. Thus we can write

\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
\log(1 - \varepsilon) + (\gamma - \delta) \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \log\Big(\frac{Y_{n-i,n}}{Y_{n-k,n}}\Big) < \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \log(U(Y_{n-i,n})) - \log(U(Y_{n-k,n})) \\
< \log(1 + \varepsilon) + (\gamma + \delta) \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \log\Big(\frac{Y_{n-i,n}}{Y_{n-k,n}}\Big).
\end{split}
\end{equation*}

The term in the middle is the hill estimator $\hat{\gamma}_H$, hence above becomes

\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
\log(1 - \varepsilon) + (\gamma - \delta) \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \log\Big(\frac{Y_{n-i,n}}{Y_{n-k,n}}\Big) < \hat{\gamma}_H \\
< \log(1 + \varepsilon) + (\gamma + \delta) \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \log\Big(\frac{Y_{n-i,n}}{Y_{n-k,n}}\Big).
\end{split}
\end{equation*}

Now it is sufficient to only prove that 

\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \log\Big(\frac{Y_{n-i,n}}{Y_{n-k,n}}\Big) \xrightarrow{p} 1.
\end{equation*}

$\log(Y_i)$ has a standard exponential distribution, since 
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
F_{\log(Y_i)}(x) = P(\log(Y_i) < x) = P(e^{\log(Y_i)} < e^x) = P(Y_i < e^x) = F_Y(e^x) = 1 - {e^{-x}}.
\end{split}
\end{equation*}

Therefore we can write
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \log\Big(\frac{Y_{n-i,n}}{Y_{n-k,n}}\Big) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} E_{n-i,n} - E_{n-k,n},
\end{equation*}
where $E_1, E_2,...$ are i.d.d. random variables from standard exponential distribution. Now Renyi's representation \ref{renrep} implies

\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
\big\{E_{n-i,n} - E_{n-k,n}\big\}_{i=0}^{k-1} \\ 
\overset{d}{=} \bigg\{\Big( \frac{E_1^*}{n} + \frac{E_2^*}{n-1}+...+ \frac{E_{n-(i+1)}^*}{n-(n-(i+1))+1} + \frac{E_{n-i}^*}{n-(n-i)+1} \Big) \\
- \Big(\frac{E_1^*}{n} + \frac{E_2^*}{n-1}+...+\frac{E_{n-k}^*}{n-(n-k)+1}\Big)\bigg\}_{i=0}^{k-1} \\
= \bigg\{\frac{E_{n-i}^*}{i+1} + \frac{E_{n-(i+1)}^*}{i+2} +...+ \frac{E_{n-(k-2)}^*}{k-1} + \frac{E_{n-(k-1)}^*}{k}\bigg\}_{i=0}^{k-1} \\
\overset{d}{=} \big\{E_{k-i,k}\big\}_{i=0}^{k-1}.
\end{split}
\end{equation*}

Consequently we have

\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \log\Big(\frac{Y_{n-i,n}}{Y_{n-k,n}}\Big) \overset{d}{=} \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} E_{k-i,k} = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} E_i \xrightarrow{p} E[E_i] = 1
\end{equation*}

by the weak law of large numbers \cite{rosenthal}. Notice that the expected value of a standard exponential is one.
